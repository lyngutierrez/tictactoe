Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player achieving a winning condition, the game ends in a draw.
